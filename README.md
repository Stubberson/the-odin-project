# The Odin Project
This is my repo for learning web development with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). At the same time, I'm learning git and GitHub.

I'll update this README file every now and then to keep track of my progress.

> I finished the Flexbox exercises with the "Holy Grail" layout for a website. However, as I was trying to mess around with git submodules, I deleted all my files. I didn't realize that a submodule has to be a self-standing repo in GitHub for it to work and being able to push to the remote directory. Oh well, better to mess up with something like this now than within a real project. Next time I'll be more careful with removing files.
