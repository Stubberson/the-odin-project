# The Odin Project
This is my repo for learning web development with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I'm going through the Foundations course which gives an introduction to HTML, CSS, JS, and Git and GitHub.

I'll update this README file every now and then to keep track of my progress.

> I finished the Flexbox exercises with the "Holy Grail" layout for a website. However, as I was trying to mess around with git submodules, I deleted all my files. I didn't realize that a submodule has to be a self-standing repo in GitHub for it to work properly. Oh well, better to mess up with something like this now rather than within a real project...

> I now added the css-exercises to this repo as a folder. I find it more intuitive to work within one repo rather than switching between repos within the odin project.
